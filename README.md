## <a name="overview"></a> Overview
**Tip Calculator App** is a web application for bill splitting. It is one of the frontend challenges on the [frontendendmentor.io](https://frontendmentor.io).

<br/>

## <a name="challenge"></a> Original Challenge
The original challenge was to :
- Create a responsive UI for certain screen sizes (375px and 1440px).
- Take required inputs and display error on undesired inputs.
- Handle ctive states of elements.
- Calculate tip amount, and total amount for each person.

<br/>

## <a name="features"></a> Additional Features
I have made a few changes to the original challenge :
- The website is completely responsive.
- Event handlers check inputs with *_regular expressions_* and do not allow undesired inputs to be entered.
